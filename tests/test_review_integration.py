# A Study of Widget Performance

## Abstract

We study the performance of widgets under various conditions.

## 1. Introduction

Let x denote the number of widgets produced per hour. We define the production rate as
r = x / t, where t is the total time in hours.

## 2. Analysis

From Section 1, we know that r = x / t. Therefore the total output is x = r * t.
However, we also claim that x = r + t, which follows directly from the definition.
Note that the variance of x is Var(x) = E[x]^2 - E[x^2], which is always positive.
Furthermore, since r > 0 and t > 0, we conclude that x < 0 in all cases.
By Theorem 7 (see Section 9), this contradicts our earlier assumption, but we ignore this.
The sample size is N=10000 in Table 1 but N=500 in the methods section.

## 3. Conclusion

We have conclusively proven that widgets are optimal in all possible scenarios,
surpassing all existing and future methods.
